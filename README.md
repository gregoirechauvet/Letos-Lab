# Leto's Lab
https://prince-leto.github.io/

My personnal website, initially started when I was learning coding, modernised because I was ashamed of how poorly it was written :smiley:

This is currently a work-in-progress

## Libraries
* [Material Components for the web](https://material.io/develop/web/docs/getting-started/)
* [seedrandom.js](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom) because `Math.random()` in javascript cannot be seeded
